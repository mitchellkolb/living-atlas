This project is intended to showcase the Living Atlas Database and Map team's product that we produced for our 2023 WSU Capstone project. We produced/deployed a full stack web application that collects and displays information relating to the Columbia River Basin.

## Acknowledgments
This codebase and all supporting materials were created as part of two courses for my undergraduate studies at WSU for CPTS 421 & 423 - Software Design Project 1 & 2 in the Spring of 2023 and Fall of 2023. This project was originally submitted to a private repository as all WSU assignments are, with forking disabled. This repository serves as a backup place to showcase this project.
