NOTES

This file is intended to be used to test my (Mitchell Kolb) skills/concepts with google cloud API.
This file serves no purpose in the functionality of the Living Atlas Backend
I just worked really hard to learn this stuff and don't wanna delete it lol cause Im proud I got it to work
If for whatever reason you want to get this file to work you have to copy the ServiceKey file that is outside of this folder into here because it needs to be at the same folder level.
